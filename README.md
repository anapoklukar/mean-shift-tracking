This project was developed for the **Advanced Computer Vision Methods** course at the University of Ljubljana. It implements and evaluates the **mean-shift tracking algorithm**, analyzing its performance through systematic experiments on synthetic data and the [VOT2014](https://www.votchallenge.net/vot2014/) benchmark. Key investigations include parameter sensitivity (e.g., kernel size, convergence threshold), tracking accuracy, computational efficiency, and characteristic limitations of the approach.  

### Repository Structure  
- `ms_tracker.py`: Core implementation of the mean-shift tracking algorithm.  
- `tracking_methods.py`: Helper functions for feature extraction, kernel operations, and evaluation metrics.  
- `run_vaja_2.py`: Main script to reproduce experiments and results from the report.  
- `Report-2.pdf`: Detailed report covering methodology, parameter analysis, results, and conclusions.
